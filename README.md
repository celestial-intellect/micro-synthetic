# micro-synthetic

This is an implementation of the Micro-Synthetic algorithm, which is a universal data mining method that uses the Normalized Compression Distance to generalize frequent pattern discovery.

Please see the draft paper at https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2167 to see what this is all about. 

A strange objection to the paper from a reviewer was that the algorithm would be too inefficient. This algorithm is not meant to be efficient, it only serves to validate the universal pattern recognition theory developed in the above paper.
